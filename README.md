# Navnelykke

Navnelykke is a web application that helps Norwegian parents find the perfect baby name. It provides searchable lists of names, inspiration articles and tools such as polls and favorites. The site is built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and stores data in Supabase.
